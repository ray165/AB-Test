### Summary:    
After analyzing Montana State University's (MSU) Library test data, we should replace the 'Interact' button with either 'Connect' or 'Services' to have the highest click through rate.

Outlay: 
The library is having trouble engaging with users through their interact button. To change things up, they hope renaming the interact-button will lead to a much higher click through rate. To identify a better alternative to interact, an AB test is done with four different variants: Connect, Learn, Help, and Services.
